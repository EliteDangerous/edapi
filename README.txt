                        False)
  --basename BASENAME   Base file name. This is used to construct the cookie
                        and vars file names. (default: edapi)
  --vars                Output a file that sets environment variables for

                        system/station. (default: False)

                        Instead of normal import, display raw API data given a
                        set of dictionary keys. (default: None)

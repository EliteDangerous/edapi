EDAPI: Elite Dangerous API Tool

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --debug               Output additional debug info. (default: False)
  --tdpath TDPATH       Path to the Trade Dangerous root. This is used to
                        locate the Trade Dangerous python modules and data/
                        directory. (default: .)
  --no-color            Disable the use of ansi colors in output. (default:
                        False)
  --basename BASENAME   Base file name. This is used to construct the cookie
                        and vars file names. (default: edapi)
  --vars                Output a file that sets environment variables for
                        current cargo capacity, credits, and current
                        system/station. (default: False)
  --ships               Write shipyards to the TD ShipVendor.csv. (default:
                        False)
  --import FILE         Import API info from a JSON file instead of the API.
                        Used mostly for debugging purposes. (default: None)
  --export FILE         Export API response to a file as JSON. (default: None)
  --eddn                Post price, shipyards, and outfitting to the EDDN.
                        (default: False)
  --keys [KEYS [KEYS ...]]
                        Instead of normal import, display raw API data given a
                        set of dictionary keys. (default: None)
  --tree                Used with --keys. If present will print all content
                        below the specificed key. (default: False)

==============================================================================
== Trade Dangerous plugin usage:
==============================================================================

Copy edapi_plug.py to the plugins directory in Trade Dangerous. Use the
import command to connect to the API and import price and shipyard
data.

Basic usage:

    trade.py import --plug edapi
      This will query the API for information abotu your currently docked
      station and import any market prices and shipyard information
      available. You will be prompted to enter any missing station information.

    trade.py imp -P edapi -O eddn
      This will do the same thing, but also post your market, shipyard, and
      outfitting modules to EDDN.

    trade.py imp -P edapi -O test=tmp/profile.20160707_202255.json
      This will load a API-response from the given file and work with that
      instead of querying to the companion API. If the EDDN option is also
      given, it will use the "test" schema instead of the production one
      and print out the sent message(s).

Options (-O):

    csvs:  Merge shipyards into ShipVendor.csv.
    edcd:  Call the EDCD plugin first
    eddn:  Post market, shipyard and outfitting to EDDN.
    name:  Do not obfuscate commander name for EDDN submit.
    save:  Save the API response (tmp/profile.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json).
    test:  Test the plugin with a json file (test=[FILENAME]).
